# Currency Converter Colter
In this assignment, you will create a React application that will convert various currencies.

For the data, you will use the API [available here](https://ratesapi.io/)

## Objectives

- Work with an API to display data
- Work with React
- Work with the React lifecycle (`componentDidMount` with classes or `useEffect` with hooks)

## Requirements

- Use [this API documentation](https://ratesapi.io/documentation/) to build a page that allows for conversion between multiple currencies

- [ ] Create a page that loads and shows the current currency conversion rates.
- [ ] Design the page yourself or use utility CSS libraries like: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ ] Use `USD` as the _base_ currency.
- [ ] Allow the user to enter a currency amount (allow for decimal amounts like `42.12`) in USD.
- [ ] Show the converted amount in each of the available currencies.
  - [ ] Either update _as the user types_ or include a button that performs the conversion when clicked.
